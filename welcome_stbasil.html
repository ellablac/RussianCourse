                        <p>One special technique weâ€™ll try is <strong>learning by teaching</strong>. It not only strengthens your own understanding of the material, but also builds community spirit.

                        <p>
                            Second-language learners often recognize the challenges that native speakers may not see, since theyâ€™ve faced the same difficulties themselves. Youâ€™re welcome (but never required) to teach the concepts you've already mastered to your peers. This can be
                            working in pairs or small groups, leading short practice activities, or presentig material in class. </p>
                        <p>This "learn by teaching" approach makes the course unique and truly community-based: we learn something new, pass it along to others, and they in turn share it with the next person.
