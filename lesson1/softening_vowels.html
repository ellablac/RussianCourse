        <h1>The Cyrillic Letter <span class="cyrillic-letter">Е (е)</span></h1>
        <p>
            The Cyrillic letter Е (е) in the Russian language is a "softening vowel". It is pronounced as a 'ye', 'e' or 'i' sound depending on position and stress in a word.
        </p>

        <h2>When Е sounds like 'ye'</h2>
        <p>
            The 'ye' sound is most noticeable at the beginning of a word, after a vowel, or after the soft sign (ь). In these instances, the sound is palatalized, similar to combining the English letters 'y' and 'e'.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>At the beginning of a word:</strong> In the word <span class="example">есть (yest')</span>, which means "to eat" or "is," Е sounds like the 'ye' in "yes".</li>
            <li><strong>After a vowel:</strong> In the word <span class="example">поесть (poyest')</span>, which means "to eat a little," the Е follows the vowel 'о' and is pronounced with the 'ye' sound.</li>
            <li><strong>After a soft sign (ь):</strong> The soft sign does not have a sound, but it indicates the following vowel should be "iotated," or pronounced with a 'y' sound. In the word <span class="example">пьеса (p'yesa)</span>, meaning "play"
                or "drama," Е is preceded by a soft sign.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When Е sounds like 'e'</h2>
        <p>
            Following a consonant, the letter Е primarily softens or palatalizes the preceding consonant. In this case, the vowel sound is closer to the 'e' in "met".
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>After a consonant:</strong> In the word <span class="example">мел (myel)</span>, meaning "chalk," Е softens the preceding 'м' sound and is pronounced like a soft 'e'.</li>
            <li><strong>In loanwords:</strong> In numerous words borrowed from other languages, Е is pronounced as a simple 'e' sound, even after a consonant that can be soft. For example, the English loanword <span class="example">теннис (tennis)</span>                is pronounced with an 'e' sound.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When Е sounds like 'eh'</h2>
        <p>
            After Sibilant Consonants the letter Е (pronounced like "eh" in "bet")
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>When е follows a sibilant consonant (ж, ц, ш, щ, or ч)</strong>, it is pronounced as its "hard counterpart," which means it takes an "eh" sound, similar to the "e" in the English word "bet". For example, <span class="example">шесть (six), центр (center), жест(gesture)</span>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The effect of stress</h2>
        <p>
            Russian vowels are reduced when unstressed, including Е.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stressed Е:</strong> When Е is stressed, it produces the clearer 'ye' sound. For example, in <span class="example">мелочь (myeloch)</span>, meaning "a small thing," the 'e' is stressed and has a distinct 'ye' quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Unstressed Е:</strong> When Е is unstressed, it is reduced and may sound closer to an 'i' or a schwa sound. In <span class="example">зелёный (zelyoniy)</span>, meaning "green," the first 'e' is unstressed and sounds more like an 'i'.
            </li>
        </ul>

        You may find it difficult to pronounce words with the letters е, ё, ю, я. When the constonant becomes soft and the vowel changes the sound to э, о, у, а, not everyone can reproduce this effect, and it comes out as "лублу" instead of "люблю." To learn
        how to pronounce these sounds, it’s good to start by practicing soft vs. hard consonants.

        <p>мол — мил, кот — кит, луг — люк, дань – день, нос – нёс, рысь – рис.</p>

        <p>After you get better at softening consonants, it will become easier to pronounce the letters е, ё, ю, я.</p>
